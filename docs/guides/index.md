# Guides

LTSP follows the [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework, which identifies
four documentation models:

- Tutorials (learning-oriented): [ltsp.org/docs](https://ltsp.org/docs) is
  meant to be read like a book.
- How-to guides (task-oriented): [ltsp.org/guides](https://ltsp.org/guides) can
  be searched for guidance on specific tasks.
- Explanation (understanding-oriented):
  [github.com/ltsp/ltsp/discussions](https://github.com/ltsp/ltsp/discussions)
  is available for asking and providing clarifications.
- Reference (information-oriented): [ltsp.org/man](https://ltsp.org/man)
  contains the man pages.

This means that the guides section isn't meant to be read sequentially. Use the
search box or the following table of contents to locate the one you're
interested in.

Documentation contributors and pull requests are most welcome, please contact
us in the [online chat room](chat-room) for details.
